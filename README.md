Their friends from the engineering and architecture departments are also involved in an irreconcilable dispute. Despite the hostility around them, these enemies find themselves growing closer instead of antagonizing each other.*
3. My School President - *My School President is a Thai BL series about an enchanting teenage love story. The protagonist is an aspiring musician who forms a high school band with his friends.
